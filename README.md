# Path_finder
A GUI based Python program to find the minimum distance path between any two points avoiding the obstacle present in between the path. Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the minimum path to a goal position from any other position.Tkinter library is used for user interface.Here matrix_gen.py module contain the code for generating adjancy matrix for each vertices.The backened.py module contains the logic for finding the minimum path for each source vertex and all vertex(including destination vertex) and also generate parent list. The  pathFinder GUI.py module contain the the code for GUI and it also connects all the modules togather.
